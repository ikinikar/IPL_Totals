# IPL_Totals
#This project attempts to predict the results of IPL matches from a Kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/code/akashdubey022/data-analysis-and-prediction-of-ipl/notebook). The model takes into account the winner of the toss, which team is batting first, which team is chasing, and what the batting first total is. In its current state, the model achieves 54-60% accuracy with the catch that it is currently overfitting and lacks a more definitive stoppage to training. I am working on a more advanced version of the same model that uses PyTorch and attempts to fix the overfitting and stoppage issues that will be posted as an update to this project.
